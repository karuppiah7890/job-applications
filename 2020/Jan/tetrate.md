Hi,

I’m Karuppiah. I found a job opening in https://www.golangprojects.com/ over [here](https://www.golangprojects.com/golang-go-job-dlo-Remote-Golang-Engineer-Backend-distributed-systems-Tetrate-remotework.html)

I have 2 years of work experience. I’m currently working at ThoughtWorks. In these two years, I have been working with Kubernetes and infrastructure tools a lot in my client project.

Our current tech stack is - Golang, GitLab CI/CD, Consul, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, Helm

I’ve quite some work experience with each of these. Enough to get work done and to iterate and improve :)

Why we do what we do in our team: To make developer experience better

What we do: I’m part of a very big infrastructure team, that is trying to standardize infrastructure and practices and work on everything that is common across product teams

How we do it: We try to understand the business, the current technologies and see the stories others tell and learn from it and apply them, keeping developers in our mind as they are our end customers

Most of our day job is about building tools for - 

    Migration from an old system to a newer better system

    Completely decommissioning old systems

    From old infrastructure to a newer and standardized one

    Deploying components very easily

    Migrating components easily with minimal downtime - we use replication and clustering concepts of components for it, and the tool does replication and fail over very easily for the migration


And in this project, over the time, we built a tool on top [helm](https://github.com/helm/helm) to use it at a large scale, with DRY concepts and for easy management of component (DBs) deployments. It was more like an opinionated alternative for helm
